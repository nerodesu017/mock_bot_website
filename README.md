# Mockup website for basic request testing (sneaker related)
## How to use?
  * install dependencies
    ```
    > npm ci // install packages from package-lock.json
    > npm install // install packages from package.json and overwrite package-lock.json
    ```
  * run the app
    ```
    > node .
    ```
## What is the purpose?
  1. This project was created for people just starting out learning about http or people just wanting to have some fun with requests. I've seen quite a few people having troubles with creating a full bot for websites, because those website either had antibots, recaptcha or both. So this is a great starting point for a basic bot.
  2. I wanted to learn a little about frontend (the bootstrap css framework) and backend (nodejs with expressjs) cause in the future I'm planning on using the PERN stack (Postgresql, Expressjs, Reactjs, Node.js)
## Is it ready for production?
  * ### You decide for yourself
  - [x] Database in a json file
  - [x] Hard-coded values
  - [x] Spaghetti code all in 1 file (index.js)
## Why is it so ugly?
  * I don't do frontend
## Any good resources for learning more about botting/sneaker-botting?
